1. A very challenging task to understand how to generated sine, trapezoid and rectangular waves using PWM.

2. Understanding of timer modules is also extremley crutial. I think exercise 5 helps in that regard. 

3. Basic understanding of fourier series, signal processing, filters etc is very essential to complete the task.

4. Code with respect to ADC and button controls are reusable from previous exercises so, the biggest challenge 
   would surely be to implement the signal generator with the help of PWM and timer interrupts using the 
   above mentioned concepts. 
   
5. Overall it was quite a challenge as there are a significant number of concepts that one should understand
   before going ahead with the implementation. 
   
6. As mentioned in the code due to memory constraints, the look up table was limited to 16 values thus reducing 
   sampling frequency resulting in a wave that might be not so perfect. 
   
7. For higher frequencies(as you start approaching 16Hz) in the trapezoidal wave and the rectangular wave, the edges 
   would be start getting more and more rounded as the wave harmonics start getting filtered out by the RC filter which
   again would result in imperfect recatngular/trapezoidal waves. 
   
8. The video demonstration may have some cuts in between due to editing and exceeds the given time by almost a minute(I hope no points can be deducted for this). 
   But I believe some editing was essential to deliver the information in a concise and an acccurate manner.
