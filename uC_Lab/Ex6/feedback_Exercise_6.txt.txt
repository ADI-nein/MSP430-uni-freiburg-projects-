1. I think this is going to be quite a challenging final task and tried to keep the flowchart as abstract as 
   possible while including all the necessary details of the generator and the scope. 

2. Understanding of both timer and ADC modules is going to very crutial for the implementation.

3. I think the SPWM generation and the ADC sampling is probably going to be the most challenging task. 
   I would like to know how accurate the sine wave output should look like after the ADC sampling. 
   For ex:Is some aliasing accepted?
   
4. Most of the features from the flowchart can be implemented but however could you please share the point
   division for each sub-part in the project? 

Regarding the feedback for assignement 3 I'll try to implement it in my code and see if I can run it as 
expected and get back to you if I'm stuck and for experiment 5 I have misunderstood that task as you've 
mentioned cost me the point but I appreciate the fact that points weren't consequently deducted for the other
subtasks. 

Happy holidays :)
