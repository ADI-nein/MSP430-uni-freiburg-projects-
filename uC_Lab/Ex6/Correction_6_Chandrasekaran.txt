Grading: 10.0 / 10.0 points

******************************

Task 1
  [+] reasonable program content and sequence    (5.0/5.0 pts.)
  [+] flowchart symbols used correctly           (2.0/2.0 pts.)
  [+] appropriate and balanced level
      of abstraction & details                   (2.0/2.0 pts.)
 
Task 2
  [+] feedback.txt                               (1.0/1.0 pt.)

Comments:

Well thought and structured flowchart. 

Answers to the questions in feedback:

3. Minimal aliasing will be tolerated and accepted. 
Feel free to try out anti-aliasing filter to remove unwanted high-frequency components
which would help in generating an accurate sine wave output after sampling. 

4. The evaluation for the project would be mainly based on implementation
of analog sampling, serial data streaming, generation of different waveforms
and how effective the amplitude and frequency control is.

For exercise 5: Since all other sub-tasks worked as expected, I was a bit considerate
in the grading process. :)

Hope this helps you. Feel free to reach out to me in case you need further clarifications.

Good luck for the implementation part!
